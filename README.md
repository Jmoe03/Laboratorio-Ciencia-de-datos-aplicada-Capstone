Capstone Project: Applied Data Science - Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

Project Description

In this capstone project, we aim to develop a model to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully after launch. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at a cost of $62 million, compared to other providers charging upwards of $165 million. Much of the cost savings are due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Determining the likelihood of a successful landing can help calculate the total launch cost and provide a competitive edge in bidding against SpaceX.

Project Objectives

Data Collection and Wrangling
Objective: Utilize web scraping and data manipulation techniques to prepare the dataset.
Tasks:
Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
Convert a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Create a Jupyter Notebook and make it shareable via GitHub.
Define and formulate a real-world business problem using data science methodologies.
Load, clean, and analyze the dataset to extract valuable insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
Tasks:
Create scatter plots and bar charts using Pandas.
Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis.
Execute SQL queries to select and sort data.
Use data visualization skills to identify meaningful patterns and guide the modeling process.
Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
Objective: Build interactive dashboards to analyze launch records and launch site proximities.
Tasks:
Develop an interactive dashboard with pie charts and scatter plots using Plotly Dash.
Calculate distances on an interactive map using the Folium library.
Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters using Folium.
Create an interactive dashboard to analyze launch records and site proximities.
Predictive Analysis (Classification)
Objective: Apply machine learning techniques to predict the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing.
Tasks:
